Welcome to our **Insubria Encrypted Oracle**.

Weâ€™ve implemented a hybrid cryptosystem where an AES-encrypted byte is further encrypted with textbook RSA. You are allowed to query the oracle with up to 40 printable inputs.

Your goal is to recover the original flag that has been encrypted byte-by-byte with AES and then RSA.

Can you break the system and retrieve the hidden flag?
