RSA is still secure, right?

We mixed in a bit of math and some factorials, just to spice things up.
Everything seems to work fine, but maybe *something* leaked...

You're given the output of some strange-looking values, and a ciphertext of the flag encrypted with RSA.

Can you recover the secret and decrypt the flag?
